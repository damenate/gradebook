<h1 text-align="center">Gradebook</h1>

<p>Gradebook application where three sets of users: teachers, parents, and students can use the application in different ways depending on authorization. </p>

<p>Teachers have the ability to add, edit, and update all categories while the parents and teachers can only view the page. Parents can only view grades attached to their kids and students can only view thier grades. </p>

<h2 text-align="center">Description</h2>

<p>Rails assignment designed to help me understand the difference between authentication and authorization.
Authentication is the process of verifying who you are while authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something.
This app was also designed to have three different types of users with seperate access to the grades. </p>
